# AI CASE STUDY

## Overview and Origin

NVIDIA Inc. was founded on April 5, 1993 by 3 men.  They are:
Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem.
They had a vision to bring 3D graphics to the gaming and multimedia markets.
Today they are trying to achieve superhuman productivity.
They are now being funded tens of millions of dollars by the stock market.

## Business Activities

They have been at the forefront of accelerated computing which has helped with the
acceleration of deep learning.

Their intended customers are Google and Microsft to Dell and HP.  While Google
and Microsoft are currently customers of Nvidia, they are also competitors.  
Although it will take them a few more years to get to Nvidia's position.
Microsoft and Google are currently #3 and #4 for the largest American companies
by market capitalization.

Nvidida offers much faster speeds from their GPUs than any other company can produce.
Since the tech industry relies on the speed of the processors that they have and
Nvidia has the fastest ones.  The competition has not been able to catch up yet.
Nvidia offers GPU's that can outperform all other chips in the market.

Here are 4 technologies that Nvidia is using:
Architectures:
Blackwell Architecture (March 2024) - Fuels accelerated computing and generative
AI with unparalleled performance, efficiency and scale.

Enterprise and Developer:
Accelerated Computing-performs exponentially more work in less time with greater
energy efficiency and less cost than traditional CPU-based computing.

Gaming:
Battery Boost - An ultra-efficient mode that delivers the same great 30+ FPS experience,
but with up to 2x longer battery life while gaming.

Industry Technologies:
AI Computing - Enables every industry to find the higher intelligence in big data
to solve the most challenging problems.

## Landscape

NVIDIA is currently pursuing fields in (Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operations),
Automotive, Consumer Internet, Energy, Financial Services, Gaming, GLobal Public Sector,
Healthcare and Life Sciences, Higher Education and Research, Industrial, Manufacturing,
Media and Entertainment, Restaurants and Quick Service, Reatail and COnsumer Packaged Goods,
Robotics, Smart Cities and Spaces, Supercomputing, Telecommunications, and US Public Sector.

Nvidia Geforce 256 was the graphics card that launched Nvidia into the tech industry.
It started the era where gaming, computing and AI evolved together.  Today they have
developed the GPU, igniting deep learning into the modern AI era of computing with the GPU
acting as the brain of computers, robots and self-driving vehicles.

What are the other major companies in this field?
ASML, GOOGLE, MICROSOFT, META, INTEL, and
MICRO DEVICES are a few of the other companies in the field of AI and chip making.

## Results

The impact that Nvidia has had on the world is huge since they revealed their GPUs
and continued on to deep learning in the last 25 years.  Their impact will be
even much greater in the next decade to come.
 
Some of the metrics used to measure success in this field are financials,
fundamental metrics and ratios.
Nvidia publishes their performance updates regulary.  Each week, Nvidia improves
their software libraries, allowing customers to get more from the same GPUs. 
For example, in a few months they were able to improve their low-latency 
Llama 70B performance 350%.
 
Nvidia is dominating their competitors.  They have passed them in their market
caps and is closing in on the #1 position in the country.

## Recommendations

I would suggest creating a service platform that would reach ordinary people to
help them organize their time and simplify their lives.
I believe that the Nvidia logo could become a well known icon just like Google
or Facebook.

I think it would benefit the company by showing people that Nvidia is here and helping
to make thier lives easier.
